                        *** Big Black Jack game ***

*   Welcome to my version of black jack. I've lost lots of money on this game while in Vegas, don't ask how much ðŸŒš.
I figure it would be fun to create since it has robbed me of my pride and money. The is pretty simple, just get to 21 or as close to it as you can without going over.

#   Technologies used:
- JavaScript    - HtML      
- CSS           - Netlify   
- github        


*   Getting Started! 
            **-------> https://bigblackjack.netlify.app/ <---------- ***

You must make a wager before you are allowed to start.
After you hit start two cards will be dealt to both you and the computer. 
You are then able to hit to recieve another card or you may choose to stay if you are satisfied with your value.
The Objective is to get Black Jack(21) or closer to it than the dealer.
You earn black jack if youre first 2 cards equal 21 and that is an automatic win and you will recieve a 3x bonus on your wager instead of the normal 2x.
If you go over 21 its an automatic loss. 

Enjoy!
